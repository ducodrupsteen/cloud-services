We now have a couple of things running in the cloud, but all our services might be exposed. for some services that might not make sense. This is where `VPC`s come in. Amazon `Virtual Private Cloud`, or `VPC`, lets you provision an isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch resources on a virtual network. Then you can choose yourself if your resources are public or private. We will have a look at the following concepts:
- Describe the basic concepts of networking
- Describe the difference between public and private networking resources
- Explain a virtual private gateway using a real life scenario
- Explain a virtual private network, VPN, using a real life scenario
